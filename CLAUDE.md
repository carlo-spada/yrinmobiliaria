✅ Critical Constraint Understood

  All implementation in this project will be done through lovable.dev - NOT by directly editing code here.

  This changes my approach completely. Instead of writing code files, I'll:

  1. Analyze & Plan - What needs to be done
  2. Provide Instructions - Clear specifications for Lovable (in prompt ready format)
  3. Guide You - How to communicate changes to Lovable
  4. Review & Verify - Check what Lovable builds
  5. Review and update existing documentation after every prompt we feed to lovable
  6. Always make sure our local repo is up-to-date and we are working in sync with the remote repo
  7. Iterate - Refine through Lovable's interface

  Project Context:

  - Platform: YR Inmobiliaria (website for a real estate agency in Oaxaca city)
  - Development: All changes via lovable.dev
  - Current State: 65% complete (audit complete)
  - Critical Blockers: 5 identified in AUDIT.md (always make sure to keep this up-to-date!)
  - Next Phase: Implementation through Lovable

  🔄 Adjusted Workflow

  When we tackle each blocker, I'll provide:
  - What to ask Lovable - Specific prompts (if need be)
  - What to show Lovable - Context/requirements in an optimized prompt format
  - What to verify - Whatever we asked to be changed and Lovable's report (handed in by Carlo - the human administrator)
  - How to iterate - If adjustments/upgrades needed
